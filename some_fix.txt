After read and test the code, finde some problems that should be optimized.
<1>The printed numbers of each line must aligned for the better interface.
    FIX: set the print format so that each number occupies the same output space.
<2>After the collision was handled, all the movable cell should move along the move direction.
    FIX: change the collision handle function according to the principle
<3>When the game should stop?
    FIX: add some condition to break the loops
<4>When come across some error inputs, the software will have some problems, for instance there being no any change after strocking the key
    FIX: debug this bug and which function leads to the problem
